Within the Galaxy framework we recommend the use of Unipept software that uses NCBI taxonomy and UniProt databases to detect unique peptides for taxonomy. Other software tools such as MetaTryp 2.0 (PMID: 32897080) can also be used to determine the taxonomic composition of the metaproteomics datasets.
